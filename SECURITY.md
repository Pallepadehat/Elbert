# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is under active development. Security fixes are applied to the latest code on the default branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:

1. Open a private report to the maintainers with:
   - Description of the issue
   - Impact and affected components
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Any proof-of-concept details
2. Allow reasonable time for triage and remediation before public disclosure.

## Response Expectations

Maintainers will aim to:

- Acknowledge reports promptly
- Validate and triage severity
- Share remediation status updates when possible
- Credit reporters when appropriate and requested
